*Do residential housing features predict gentrification in London?*

A few steps to get started:

1. Start by cloning this repo to your computer. 
2. Create a virtual environment. 
3. Install the necessary packages (pandas, numpy, elasticsearch are needed for this repository)
4. Have a look at the notebook - a demonstration of how to connect to the dataset, and start analysing the data is given in [1_0_1_db_connection.ipynb](1_0_1_db_connection.ipynb). There are some functions that use the ElasticSearch syntax to query in [elastic_search_fncs.py](elastic_search_fncs.py), and a function to help with some basic formnatting of the dataframe in [preprocessing_fncs.py](preprocessing_fncs.py).
